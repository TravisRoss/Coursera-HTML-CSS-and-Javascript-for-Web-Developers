                <p>
                    Originally a boxer, Columbu won the Mr. Olympia in 1976 and 1981, and competed in the inaugural edition of the World's Strongest Man in 1977, where he placed fifth. He also had an acting career and authored numerous books on bodybuilding and nutrition. Columbu was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2001, and received the Arnold Classic Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.

                    Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.[8][19] His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.

                <h2>Lee Priest</h2>
                <p>
                    Priest competed successfully within the IFBB for 16 years. After falling shy of a notable championship, Priest set his sights on his most elusive opponent The Ironman Pro. After ten years of coming in 2nd or 3rd, 2006 proved Priest's year as the Ironman Pro. In 2010 he was invited by Paul Dillett to compete in the WBFF, but due to the lack of competition, he decided against competing.
